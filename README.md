### *Transforming Mini-Grid Performance Data into Smart Financial Incentives*

</div>

##  **Project Overview**

The **QA-RBF Mini-Grid Dashboard** revolutionizes how mini-grid projects are financed and monitored in developing regions. By implementing a sophisticated **3-Stage Payment Model** combined with **adaptive percentile-based benchmarking**, this dashboard ensures that funding flows are directly tied to both infrastructure deployment and sustained service quality.

###  **Key Problems Solved**

| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
|  **Lack of Performance Accountability** | 3-stage payments tied to connections + service quality |
|  **Inflexible Benchmarking** | Adaptive percentile thresholds that evolve with data |
|  **Complex Payment Calculations** | Automated multi-stage payout computation |
|  **Limited Stakeholder Transparency** | Interactive visualizations for all stakeholders |
|  **One-size-fits-all Approaches** | Context-sensitive performance zones |

---

##  **Features**

###  **3-Stage Payment Model**
- ** Stage 1 (30%)**: Connection-based milestone payments with percentage thresholds
- **Stage 2 (50%)**: Quality assessment after 3-month monitoring period  
- **Stage 3 (20%)**: Sustained performance verification after 6 months

### **Adaptive Performance Benchmarking**
- **Dynamic Thresholds**: Automatically adjusts to sector performance evolution
- **Performance Zones**: Bonus (>95th percentile) | Standard (90th-95th) | Penalty (<90th)
- ** Manual Overrides**: Accountable threshold adjustments for exceptional circumstances

###  **Multi-Metric Performance Analysis**
- ** SAIDI**: System Average Interruption Duration Index (50% weight)
- **SAIFI**: System Average Interruption Frequency Index (30% weight)  
- ** Undervoltage**: Power quality monitoring (20% weight)

##  **Key Performance Indicators**

###  **Financial Metrics**
- **Total Project Payouts** across all stages
- **Stage-wise Payment Breakdown** with performance multipliers
- **Connection-based vs Performance-based** payment allocation

###  **Technical Metrics**
- **SAIDI Average** across selected sites and timeframes
- **Performance Zone Distribution** (Bonus/Standard/Penalty)
- **Connection Completion Rates** relative to targets

###  **Comparative Analysis**
- **Best/Worst Performing Sites** by reliability metrics
- **Network-wide Performance Trends** over time
- **Minigrid-to-Minigrid Comparisons** via sunburst visualization

## **Data Requirements**

###  **Input Files Structure**

| File | Required Columns | Description |
|------|------------------|-------------|
| `DRC_minigrid_undervoltage_2023.csv` | `day`, `site_id`, `minigrid_name`, `undervoltage_duration` | Power quality data |
| `DRC_minigrid_saifi_2023.csv` | `day`, `site_id`, `minigrid_name`, `SAIFI` | Outage frequency data |
| `DRC_minigrid_saidi_2023.csv` | `day`, `site_id`, `minigrid_name`, `SAIDI` | Outage duration data |

###  **Data Specifications**
- ** Date Format**: YYYY-MM-DD (pandas parseable)
- ** Site Identifiers**: Consistent across all files
- ** Metrics**: Numeric values in appropriate units
- ** Coverage**: Complete temporal coverage preferred

## **Configuration Options**

###  **Payment Structure Customization**
```
stage_1_pct = 30  # Connection milestone percentage
stage_2_pct = 50  # Quality assessment percentage  
stage_3_pct = 20  # Sustained performance percentage (auto-calculated)
```

###  **Performance Thresholds**
```
p_standard_low = 0.90   # 90th percentile boundary (penalty threshold)
p_standard_high = 0.95  # 95th percentile boundary (standard threshold)
```

### **Connection Model**
```
connection_completion_pct = 70  # Percentage required for Stage 1
stage_1_cap = 0.30             # Maximum 30% of total project cost
```
